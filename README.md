This C program processes text from an input file (input.txt) and writes a formatted output to another file (output.txt). It performs several operations such as converting lowercase letters to uppercase after punctuation, replacing digits with asterisks, and ensuring lines have a maximum of 25 characters, filling in spaces when necessary. It also formats the output with line counts and ensures proper handling of punctuation and spaces based on specific rules.
