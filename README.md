This program processes a text file and outputs the formatted result to another file, modifying the content based on several conditions.

Purpose:
Reads characters from input.txt and writes them to output.txt, applying transformations, spacing, and formatting.
Key Functionalities:
File Handling:

Opens input.txt for reading and output.txt for writing.
Handles errors if files cannot be opened.
Character Processing:

Converts lowercase letters to uppercase after punctuation marks (. ! ?).
Replaces digits with *.
Adds a space after punctuation marks unless the next character is a space.
Line Formatting:

Maintains a fixed line length of 25 characters.
Adds spaces to complete lines shorter than 25 characters.
Appends a marker | c:X at the end of each line, where X is the number of characters read in that line.
Special Conditions:

Skips carriage return characters (\r).
Ensures proper handling of newline characters and spaces to avoid formatting errors.
Summary:
This program demonstrates:

File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
Character Handling: Using functions like isalpha, isdigit, and ispunct.
Dynamic Formatting: Ensures fixed-width lines and applies transformations.
