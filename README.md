The code appears to process a text file, formatting its content and outputting the results into another file. It implements several features, such as capitalization, punctuation handling, digit replacement, and line padding to maintain a specific format.


Key Observations:
Input/Output File Handling:

The program uses FILE_INPUT and FILE_OUTPUT macros for input and output filenames, which is a good practice for flexibility.
Proper error handling is implemented when opening files.
Line Formatting:

Each line in the output file is padded to 25 characters.
If the counter reaches 25, the program appends | c:<count> to the line to indicate the character count.
Character Transformation:

Digits (isdigit) are replaced with *.
The first letter after a punctuation mark (. ! ?) is capitalized.
Excessive carriage return characters (\r) are ignored.
